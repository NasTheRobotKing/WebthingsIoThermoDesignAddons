This is a webthings.io gateway repository for addons. 
The current addons are all functional "as is" and can be placed under the "/home/pi/.webthings/addons" path of the Webthing.io gateway running on the Pi. 
In order to push the addon onto the Things screen of the gateway, you'll need to refer to them by their URL with their specified port numbers, in the following case, port 8888 was used, ex: http://<deviceip>:8888
